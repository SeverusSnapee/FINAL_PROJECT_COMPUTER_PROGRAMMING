Carbon Footprint Report Generator

This Python project calculates the carbon footprint of clients based on their energy consumption, transport distance, and waste generation. It generates a detailed PDF report for each client and a trend graph comparing carbon footprints, energy usage, transport, and waste for multiple clients.
Features

    Calculates carbon footprint based on energy consumption, transport distance, and waste generation.

    Generates a PDF report for each client with a detailed breakdown of their footprint and suggestions to reduce it.

    Creates a summary graph comparing the carbon footprint, energy, transport, and waste of multiple clients.

Prerequisites

Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can install Python from here.
Python Libraries Needed:

    pandas – For managing data.

    matplotlib – For plotting the carbon footprint trend graph.

    fpdf – For generating the PDF report.

    reportlab – For creating professional PDF reports.

To install the required libraries, run the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

requirements.txt:

pandas
matplotlib
fpdf
reportlab

Usage

    Clone the repository.

    Navigate to the project directory.

    Run the Python script:

    python main.py

    The script will prompt you to enter data for each client (Energy in kWh, Transport distance in km, Waste in kg).

    For each client, a PDF report will be generated in the Reports folder, and a summary graph (carbon_trends.png) will be generated at the end.

Example Output

For each client, a PDF will contain:

    Client's energy, transport, waste, and carbon footprint data.

    Suggestions on how to reduce their carbon footprint.

A sample graph will display trends of carbon footprint, energy usage, transport, and waste for multiple clients.

When you will run the code you will generate individual pdf for each client in the reports folder and a collective png comparing all clients in the main folder.
